        <h1>Project Summary</h1>
       
        <p>The topic of my website is a personal portfolio. The purpose is to consolidate my experience and projects into one platform. I used 3 of the extras: zoom.js, jGravity jQuery, and the hover jQuery to create the appear upon hover effect.</p>
        <p>The website landing page is the home page, which uses an minimalistic approach to focus the attention on the nav bar, which directs users to details about me and my work.</p>
        <p>The bio tab is an about me section, where I used the gravity jQuery to make word boxes that describe me fall from the top of the website. The link for the jQuery can be found <a href="https://github.com/tinybigideas/jGravity" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
        <p>Under the career tab, users can find my professional and educational journey. Here, I used the hover transform jQuery effect to give the "appear" effect. The link for the jQuery can be found <a href="https://api.jquery.com/hover/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
        <p>The project tab is a very simple layout and short description incorporated with the zoom jQuery. Upon clicking on the lilypads in the pond, which represents each of the projects I've worked on, the page zooms with a closer view of what the project entails. The link for the jQuery can be found <a href="https://www.codehim.com/zoom/jquery-image-zoom-in-zoom-out-on-click-fat-zoom-js/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
        <p>Finally, the contact page lays out all the ways users can reach me.</p>
